This tester shows how a java application on the cRIO can collect distance and direction to a target as calculated
by the viking_cv program running on the BeagleBone.  This text stream could as easily be sent to the driver station.

To build all you need is the most recent JDK and Netbeans 7.3.1 or later.  
Edit the source code to set the IP address to point to the BeagleBone, (e.g. "10.42.76.120:5801")
Once built, the resulting jar file should be able to run on any machine with a Java Runtime (JRE) installed.

This client and/or a browser client can be connected simultaneously, but the update rate will be much
slower as the pace will be set by the rate that frames can be transmitted to the browser.

Note that if both browser and java client are used at the same time, and either the browser or this java client 
breaks the connection, both connections will be broken.
